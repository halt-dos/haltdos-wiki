# Anti-DDoS

Bullet-proof DDoS protection to ensure your website remains secure and online - all the time.

---

## Overview

Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is self-explanatory. It is a malicious attempt to deny service to legitimate users. How? By overwhelming the targeted server, network or service with a flood of Internet traffic. Here distributed implies multiple sources attacking the same target at the same time.

All Haltdos Cloud Security-as-a-Service is secured by DDoS protection service.


## Worldwide Coverage

Our cloud DDoS protection service is backed by a global network of scrubbing centers of multiple CSPs. With over 30 Tbps (and counting) of total bandwidth capacity across our infrastructure partners, our platform can stop DDoS attacks many times larger than the largest attack ever recorded. These centers are comprehensively connected in full mesh mode, via Anycast routing. It ensures mitigation closest to the point of origin of the attack.

## Types of DDoS Attacks

| PARAMETER| VOLUMETRIC| PROTOCOL| APPLICATION|
|--------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| What does it mean? | This attack uses an enormous amount of traffic saturating the targetâ€™s bandwidth | This attack makes a target inaccessible. It exploits a weakness in Layer 3 and Layer 4 protocol      | It exploits a weakness in Layer 7 protocol stack                                                                     |
| How it Impacts?     | Completely blocks access to the end-resource                                     | Consumes the comprehensive processing ability of intermediate critical resources and attacked target | Creates a connection with the target and exhaust the resources of the server by dominating transaction and processes |
| Add-on Info        | Easy to generate                                                                 | Measured in magnitude as packets per second (pps)                                                    | Most sophisticated/ challenging attack                                                                               |

**Comprehensive DDoS Protection**

Our advanced global network leverages top-of-the-line, customized servers and networking equipment that protect against Layer 3-4 DDoS attacks at the device. This approach gives our platform simultaneously an exceptionally large and exceptionally deep protection plane.

## How Does It Work?

Haltdos Cloud is a managed deployment of Haltdos Platform across multiple Cloud Service Providers. While each CSP may offers Anti-DDoS protection against volumetric DDoS attacks, Haltdos Cloud uses its indigenious Anti-DDoS-as-a-Service as the first layer of defence for mitigating Layer 3 to Layer 7 attacks. In combination with leveraging the infrastructures of various CSP partners, Haltdos Cloud can protect DDoS attacks of any size, any type, and anywhere! 

The benefits of Haltdos Cloud Scrubbing is as follows:

- High volume attack mitigation using multi-Tbps infrastructure
- Advanced mitigation against sophisticated attacks
- DDoS attacks are isolated around the source of origin of attack
- Traffic originating from one region does not transcends borders thereby ensuring data localization and residency
- No impact on end user-experience even during attack
- Protection against 0-day attacks from Layer 3-7

## Web Application Layer DDoS Protection

Haltdos Cloud WAF-as-a-Service comes with built-in protection against Layer7 DDoS attacks. The WAF detects and mitigates sophisticated Layer 7 DDoS attacks using:

- Advanced Threshold-based limiting
- Geo-IP based filtering
- Automatic Bot Detection & Mitigation
- Smart JS challenge to validate Human activity
- Crypto Challenge to deter Bot attacks
- Built-in auto-scaling for handling large spikes of traffic
- Leveraging AI/ML algorithms to analyze traffic, understand what constitutes genuine behavior, and block malicious attacks automatically.
