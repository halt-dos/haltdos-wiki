### **How to enable/disable caching?**

#### **Problem Statement**

The client wants to enable and configure caching of responses received.

#### **Solution**

When caching is enabled, WAF saves responses in a directory and uses them to respond to clients without having to proxy requests for the same content every time.

**Steps to Solve**:-

1. Login into Haltdos console.

2. Go to **WAF** > **Listeners** > **Load Balancing** > **Caching**.

3. User can Enable/Disable caching with the help of Enable Caching toggle.
