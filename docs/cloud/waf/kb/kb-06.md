:::note Note
Ensure that the Public Key uploaded has proper chaining certificate. Missing chaining certificates in an SSL/TLS connection can lead to trust chain issues. Without a complete chain, users may face SSL/TLS errors, and security risks, like man-in-the-middle attacks, are heightened. Ensuring proper configuration by including intermediate certificates is vital for maintaining a secure and trusted connection on websites.
