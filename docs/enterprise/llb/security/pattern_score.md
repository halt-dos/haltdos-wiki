# Pattern Score

## Overview

In todayâ€™s networks, cyber-attacks cause damage or theft and disrupt services with enormous economic and financial impacts. Software implementations cannot meet performance goals; a combination of software and hardware can be more effective for high-performance pattern matching. Packet content scanning at high speed has become extremely important due to its applications in network security, network monitoring, and traffic management in general. 

Haltdos supports pattern scoring on the behalf of the behavior of the packet.

Under the packet scoring section, users can configure what kind of severity level should be used while setting up the packet score.
In Haltdos Link Load Balancer solution, we provide packet score to all packets those are going through the solution. We have defined here three categories of packet scoring which can be customizable by the users. User can change the packet scoring mechanism from low, medium and high.
The low level indicates that packet scoring will be start from lower level and
