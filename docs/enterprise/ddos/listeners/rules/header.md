# Header Rules
Helps to modify headers, cookies, and arguments in the request sent to the back-end server as well as modifying response sent to the client.

### Overview 
We have introduced Header rules by which application owners can manipulate request headers, cookies, and arguments in request as well as response headers. Users can create/update header rules at run time with on-the-fly updates. It has the functionality to add/remove/update any cookie/header/arguments in the request to the web-server(back-end) as well as respond to the client.

If the action is **REMOVE**, then the specified parameter is removed.

If the action is **OVERWRITE**, then two other fields are required first is **Search Pattern** (string/regex that should match the existing value) and **Replace** (the string that should be overwritten). We can capture string from the PCRE capturing group using position with a prefix of '$'.
