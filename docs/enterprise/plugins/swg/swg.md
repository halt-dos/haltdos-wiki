# Haltdos Secure Web Gateway

Haltdos Secure Web Gateway (SWG) offers a robust SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy that efficiently handles HTTP/1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and WebSockets traffic. This plugin allows the gateway to inspect, decrypt, and analyze encrypted web traffic in real-time, ensuring that organizations maintain visibility and control over their network activities. Here are some key features and capabilities of Haltdos SWG:

### Key Features and Capabilities of Haltdos SWG:

#### Advanced SSL/TLS Interception:  
Haltdos SWG is equipped with SSL/TLS interception capabilities, enabling it to decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt web traffic securely. This feature allows the gateway to monitor encrypted traffic, which is crucial for identifying and mitigating threats that may be hidden in secure connections.

#### Support for Multiple HTTP Versions:  
The gateway supports HTTP/1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3, ensuring compatibility with the latest web standards. This versatility allows organizations to handle a wide range of web traffic, including modern applications that leverage newer protocols for enhanced performance and security.

#### WebSockets Traffic Handling:  
Haltdos SWG is capable of inspecting and managing WebSocket traffic, which is essential for real-time web applications like chat apps and live updates. This capability ensures that even interactive and persistent connections are secure and compliant with security policies.

#### Connection Management and Optimization:  
With features such as connection strategies (e.g., eager connections) and keepalive pings for HTTP/2, Haltdos SWG optimizes the way connections are managed. This results in reduced latency, efficient resource utilization, and improved user experience.

#### Selective Traffic Blocking:  
The gateway offers the ability to block connections from specific public or private address ranges, giving administrators control over which sources can access their networks. This feature helps in mitigating unwanted or potentially harmful traffic from entering the network.

#### Performance Optimization through Compression Control:  
By offering an option to disable anti-compression, Haltdos SWG can handle data in its original compressed or uncompressed form, balancing between inspection needs and performance.

#### Robust SSL/TLS Configuration Options:  
With configurable minimum and maximum TLS versions for both client and server connections, Haltdos SWG allows organizations to enforce their desired security standards, accommodating legacy systems while supporting the latest protocols.

#### Security Through Upstream Certificate Verification:  
The gateway includes upstream certificate verification, adding an extra layer of security by ensuring that the certificates from upstream servers are valid and trusted. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures the integrity of the secure communication channels.
