### Description:

##### **Enable IPv6**

This option allows user to enable traffic over IPv6 and applicable in the case of all service types. Internet Protocol version 6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol that allows communication to take place over the network.

##### **Enable Http 2.0**

This option allows user to specify whether the solution supports HTTP 2.0 request. HTTP/2 aims to be a faster, more efficient protocol than HTTP. Read more about the differences between the two and how you can get started with HTTP2 today.

##### **Enable WebSocket**

This option allows user to enable web-socket support for servers or server group. It is a communication, an upgraded, quick, and seamless protocol to use when one needs to establish constant client-server communication over a single TCP connection.

##### **Enable HTTP Keepalive**

This option allows users to enable HTTP Keep-alive for client connections. HTTPKeep-Alive can speed up website as the browser only needs to go through the process of connecting to the server once through a single TCP connection.

##### **Enable Device Detection**

This option allows users to detect devices and its OS on the client-side in the case of service type HTTP. If the user enabled this option, they can enable the device-based upstream rules.

##### **Operational Mode**

Users are allowed to specify Operational mode for the application. There are two modes can be selected:
1. Reverse Proxy 
2. Transparent

##### **Proxy Protocol**

Users are allowed to specify Proxy protocol for the application.

##### **Enable Logging**

This option allows user to enable access logs in the case of service type HTTP & TCP’s.

##### **Client connection Timeout**

Connection timeout is a time period within which a connection between a client and a server must be established. This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP & TCP. This option allows users to set the connection timeout values from client-side.

##### **Client Resume Timeout**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP & TCP. This option allows users to specify the time within which a lost client connection can resume.

##### **Max Concurrent Connections**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP & TCP. This option allows users to specify max allowed concurrent connections. By default, Set 0 to disable.

##### **Keep-Alive Timeout**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify a timeout of keep-alive connections with clients.

##### **HTTP Request Timeout**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify client HTTP request timeout.

##### **User Session Duration**

Users can specify max allowed user session duration in minutes.

##### **Session Cookie**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify the session cookie for tracking active users.

##### **Max Concurrent User Sessions**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify max allowed concurrent user sessions. Set 0 to disable.

##### **Max Session Exceeded Action**

Users can specify the action to take when max session count exceeds.

##### **Remote IP Header**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify the header for extracting remote IP.

##### **Server Aliases**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify named aliases for this listener.

##### **Virtual IPs**

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify assigned virtual IPs for accepting traffic.
