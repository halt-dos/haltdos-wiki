# Load Balancing

---

### Overview 

Load balancing across multiple application instances is a commonly used technique for optimizing resource utilization, maximizing throughput, reducing latency, and ensuring fault-tolerance configurations.

##### **Load Balancing Algorithms**
This field specifies the load balancing algorithm according to the configured website.

1. **ROUND ROBIN**: 
This algorithm is a smart approach to distribute client requests across an array of servers. It forwards the client request to each server in turn. Also, assigns a weight to each server as per current load and idle capacity.

2. **LEAST CONNECTIONS**: This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which has the least no. of active connections on the server.

3. **LEAST RESPONSE TIME**: This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have used least bandwidth for serving the client requests.

4. **LEAST BANDWIDTH**:This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have a small response time in order to serve requests.

5. **IP HASH**: This algorithm takes the client's and server's source and destination IP address to generate a unique hash key. This key is used to assign the client to a specific server. In the case of a broken session, the key can be regenerated, and the client can be directed to the same server. 

6. **PERSISTENT HASH**: This algorithm takes the user input location within the current request to generate a user-defined custom unique hash key. This key is used to assign the client to a specific server. In the case of a broken session, the key can be regenerated, and the client can be directed to the same server. NOTE: In hashing-based load balancing, if a specified value does not exist then the request is served on the basis of client's IP address.

7. **Least Requests:**
This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have served the minimum amount of requests.

8. **SNMP Metrics**: This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have the least CPU / RAM usage. NOTE: For this algorithm to work, the server group should have SNMP monitor attached.

### How to Use:

1. Go to **Stack** > [**SLB**](/enterprise/adc) > [**Listeners**](../listeners.md) >[** Server Groups**](./server_groups.md) > **Select Server Name** > **Load Balancing**  

2. Configure your settings.  

3. Click **Save Changes**.
