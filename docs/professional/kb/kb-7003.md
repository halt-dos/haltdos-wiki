### How to enable Caching using WAF PE?

When caching is enabled, WAF saves responses in a directory and uses them to respond to clients without having two proxy requests for the same content every time. Caching is a process of storing and retrieving data locally for scalability and performance of the application.



### Solution

For enabling the caching of the application customer needs to follow certain steps

1. Login to Haltdos Console.
2. Now go to **WAF** > **Listener** > click on **Add listener**.
