#### **How to decrypt SSL/TLS traffic using Wireshark and private keys?**


#### Pre-Requisites

You must meet the following pre-requisites to use this procedure:  

   1. Wireshark software
   2. **Private Key:** You need the private key of the server used in the SSL/TLS connection. This method only works for protocols like HTTPs where you have access to the private key.
   3. The RSA private key file is in PEM format.

#### Steps

   1. **Load the Captured File**
      
      1. Open Wireshark and load your .pacp
   
   2. **Configure the SSL/TLS Preferences**
      
      1. Go to **Edit > Preferences**
      2. Expand the protocols list on the left side.
      3. Scroll down and select TLS or SSL (depending on your Wireshark version)
   
   3. **Add the Private key**
      
      1. In the same preferences window under TLS or SSL, find the RSA keys list.
      2. Click on the Edit button
      3. Add a new entry with the following details: 
         
         1. **IP address:** The IP adress of the server.
         2. **Port:**  The port number(e.g, 443 for HTTPS)
         3. **Protocol:** Typically, HTTP
         4. **Key File:** Browse and select the server's private key file
         5. **Password:**  If the key file is encrypted, enter the password.
   
   4. **View Decrypted Data**
      
      1. After adding the private key, Wireshark will automatically decrypt the SSL/TLS traffic
      2. You should be able to see the decrypted content under the Decrypted SSL or Decrypted TLS sections in the packet details pane
