#### **How to decrypt SSL/TLS using Wireshark and SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable on Firefox or Google Chrome using Wireshark?**

#### Pre-Requisites

   1. Wireshark Software
   2. Firefox or Chrome browsers to access the web application
   3. SSL session keys

##### How to log the SSL session keys on windows
      
   1. Open the Environment Variables by right-clicking on **This PC** and selecting **Properties**.
   2. Click on **Advanced system settings** on the left.
   3. In the System Properties window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.
   4. Under **System variables**, click "New".
   5. In the **Variable name** field, enter `SSLKEYLOGFILE`.
   6. In the **Variable value** field, enter the path where you want the SSL keys to be saved, e.g., `C:\path\to\sslkeys.log`.
   7. Select **OK**
   8. Start Firefox or Chrome
   9. Access the web application.Now, whenever you visit the application using SSL/TLS, the session keys will be logged to the specified file.

##### How to log the SSL session keys on Linux
      
1. Open a terminal
2. Create an empty file to store the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable

   ```
   touch sslkeyfile
   ```

3. Set the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable for your account by using the following command syntax: <br/>
  
      ```
      export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/path/to/logfile/sslkeyfile
      ```
      For example:  
      
      ```
      export SSLKEYLOGFILE=/home/test/sslkeyfile.log
      ````

3. Start packet capture using an application such as Wireshark or **tcpdump**. For information about **tcpdump** refer to [How to capture packet and tracethem through tcp dump utility?](./kb-1069.md)
4. Start Firefox or Chrome from the same terminal window that was used to set the environmental variable <br/> <br/>
  For example
   `google-chrome`
  
  :::note Note
  Make sure to close all open browser windows, and always start the browser from the same command terminal, as the session variable is set only in that terminal.
  :::
    
5. Access the web application. Now, whenever you visit the application using SSL/TLS, the session keys will be logged to the specified file.

#### How to decrypt SSL/TLS traffic using Wireshark with SSLKEYLOGFILE

<!-- [Download the Sample keyfile](/static/file/enterprise/kb/prikeyfile) -->

[Download the Sample .pcap](/file/enterprise/kb/pri.pcap)


#### Steps
1. **Load the Captured File**

   1. Capture the traffic using `tcpdump` based on your requirements: from the client to the WAF machine or from the WAF machine to the backend server.

      **From Client to WAF Machine**  
      1. SSH into the WAF machine.  
      1. Start capturing packets using `tcpdump`.  

        **For example:**  
        ```bash
        tcpdump -i any port 443 and host <Client IP> -w dump.pcap
        ```

      **From WAF Machine to Server**  
      1. SSH into the server machine.  
      1. Start capturing packets using `tcpdump`.  

        **For example:**  
        ```bash
        tcpdump -i any port 443 and host <WAF IP> -w dump.pcap
        ```

   2. Open Wireshark. 
   
   :::note NOTE
   Ensure that both the .pcap file and the SSL key file are present on the same machine where Wireshark will be used. 
   ::: 

   3. Load the traffic `tcpdump` file in .pcap format. 

2. **Configure the SSL/TLS Preferences**

   To upload captured TCP dump on wireshark.

   1. Go to **File** > **Open**
   2. Select your .pcap file and Select Open.
   3. This will show the list of captured packets.
   
   Then we need to configure the TLS/SSL preference to decrypt the required file.

   1. Go to **Edit > Preferences**
   2. Expand the protocols list on the left side.
   3. Scroll down and select TLS or SSL (depending on your Wireshark version)

3. **Set the Pre-Master Secret Log File**
   
   1. In the **Pre-Master-Secret log filename** field, click **Browse** and select the sslkeys.log file that your browser has been writing to.
   2. Apply the settings by clicking **OK**.
   
4. **View Decrypted Data**
   
   1. Wireshark should now automatically decrypt the SSL/TLS traffic using the session keys from sslkeys.log
   2. You can inspect the decrypted packets, including HTTP requests and responses, directly in Wireshark
