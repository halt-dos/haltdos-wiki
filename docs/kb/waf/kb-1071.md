#### **How to decrypt SSL/TLS using Wireshark and SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable on Firefox or Google Chrome using Wireshark?**

#### Pre-Requisites

   1. Wireshark Software
   2. Firefox or Chrome browsers to access the web application

##### How to log the SSL session keys on windows
      
   1. Open the Environment Variables by right-clicking on **This PC** and selecting **Properties**.
   2. Click on **Advanced system settings** on the left.
   3. In the System Properties window, click on the **Environment Variables** button.
   4. Under **System variables**, click "New".
   5. In the **Variable name** field, enter `SSLKEYLOGFILE`.
   6. In the **Variable value** field, enter the path where you want the SSL keys to be saved, e.g., `C:\path\to\sslkeys.log`.
   7. Select **OK**
   8. Start Firefox or Chrome
   9. Access the web application.Now, whenever you visit the application using SSL/TLS, the session keys will be logged to the specified file.

##### How to log the SSL session keys on Linux
      
1. Open a terminal
2. Set the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable for your account by using the following command syntax: <br/>`export SSLKEYLOGFILE="/path/to/logfile/sslkeyfile`<br/><br/> For example: <br/> `export SSLKEYLOGFILE="/home/test/sslkeyfile.log`
3. Start packet capture using an application such as Wireshark or **tcpdump**. For information about **tcpdump** refer to [How to capture packet and tracethem through tcp dump utility?](./kb-1069.md)
4. Start Firefox or Chrome from the same terminal <br/> <br/>
  For example
   `google-chrome`
  
  :::note Note
  You must start the browser from the same command terminal beacause the session variable is set only on the terminal
