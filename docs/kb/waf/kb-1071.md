#### How to decrypt SSL/TLS using Wireshark and SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable on Firefox or Google Chrome using Wireshark?


#### Pre-Requisites

You must meet the following pre-requisites to use this procedure: 

   1. Wireshark Software
   2. Firefox or Chrome browsers on the client system to access a web application

#### Steps

   1. Log the SSL keys on windows
      
      1. Open environment variables by selecting the Windows icon at the bottom left corner of your screen and enter **env**
      2. Select **Edit environment variables for your account**
      3. In the **Environment variables** pop-up window, select **New**
      4. For **variable name**, enter the following name:  `SSLKEYLOGFILE`
      5. For **Variable Value**, enter the full path name for the SSL log file. For example: `C:\Users\test\Desktop\sslkeylog.txt`
      6. Select **OK**
      7. Start Firefox or Chrome
      8. Access a web application and perform the steps you want to troubleshoot. As you do this, the SSL session keys are logged in the file
   
   2. Log the SSL session keys on Linux
      
      1. Open a terminal for command line access
      2. Set the SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable for your account by using the following command syntax: `export SSLKEYLOGFILE="/path/to/logfile/sslkeyfile` <br/><br/> For example: <br/> `export SSLKEYLOGFILE="/home/test/sslkeyfile`
      3. Start packet capture using an application such as Wireshark or **tcpdump**. For information about **tcpdump** refer to [How to capture packet and trace them through tcp dump utility?](./kb-1069.md)
      4. Start Firefox or Chrome from the same terminal <br/> <br/>
        For example

            google-chrome
        
        :::note
        You must start the browser from the same command terminal beacause the session variable is set only on the terminal
        :::
       
      5. Access a web application and perform the steps you want to troubleshoot. As you do this, the SSL session keys are logged in the file.
