### **How to configure record and then enable load balancing?**

#### **Problem Statement**

Client want to balance load or traffic on certain IP for a particular Zone. 
​
:::note NOTE
    - A **DNS zone** is a section of the DNS namespace that is managed by a specific authoritative DNS server. In GSLB, zones help define and control how traffic is routed to different servers based on load, location, or health checks.  
    
    - A **DNS record** in GSLB defines how traffic is distributed across multiple data centers or servers. These records help direct users to the best-performing or nearest server based on policies like:
