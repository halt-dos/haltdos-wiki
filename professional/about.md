# About Professional WAF

**Haltdos WAF Professional Edition (PE)**, the first of its type, is a user-friendly Web application firewall that is fit for any business. The **Haltdos WAF Professional Edition(PE)** protects your website from OWASP 10 threads, XSS, SQL injection, and other web-based dangerous attackers.

Websites have evolved into the major channel via which most organizations communicate information with their consumers and stakeholders. It has become quite difficult to protect web apps against fraudulent requests intended to bring your website down.

A **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**, as opposed to a Network Firewall, filters traffic on internet-facing web applications, including APIs. A **WAF** is especially useful for a firm that offers an e-commerce site, online financial services, or any other form of web-based product or service that involves contacts with clients or business partner. **WAF** can be extremely beneficial in avoiding fraud and data breaches in these situations.
