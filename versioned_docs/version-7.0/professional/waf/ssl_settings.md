# SSL Settings


It provides functionality to support SSL offloading based on configurations.

---

### Overview

As many applications are running over HTTPS, for the WAF / ADC solution to inspect user payload, it is necessary to decrypt SSL/TLS traffic. The following settings allow users to configure SSL offloading based and optional re-encryption in Haltdos solution. The performance of SSL offloading will vary based on chosen model.
