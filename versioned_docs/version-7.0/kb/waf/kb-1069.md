### **Generate/Issue SSL certificate using Let's Encrypt**

#### **Problem Statement**

End-user want to issue trusted SSL certificate using Let's Encrypt for FQDN that configured behind the Haltdos WAF to achive below operation

* Secure communication between client and WAF over public internet
* SSL certificate should be issued from trusted certificate authority
* Secure communication using strong SSL protocol and cipher suites
* Perform SSL Offloading for WAF inspection over HTTPs

#### **Pre-requistics**

* FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) should be behind Haltdos WAF (for HTTP challenge) and accessible from public internet.
* Haltdos Console login with minimum READ_WRITE access.
* Connectivity based on challenge as follows
    - For HTTP challenge, no geo-filtering policy enforced on the FQDN public IP.
    - For DNS challenge, READ WRITE access to DNS console for create TXT record.

:::note
* For HTTP challenge, verify no Geo/IP blocking policy on the network and web application firewall to avoid failure of the verification request.
> Let's Encrypt issue SSL certificate with validity of 3 months from the date of issue.
:::

### **SUMMARY**
---

1. Login to Haltdos Console
2. Create request to generate SSL certificate for FQDN
3. Choose Let'ts Encrypt challenge
4. Changes for HTTP challenge verification
5. Remove changes after challenge verification
6. Attach issued SSL certificate
7. Verify SSL certificate
---

### **Solution**

1. ### Login into Haltdos Console.

    ![login-page](/img/waf/v7/kb/console-login.png)

    * Go to **Stack** > **Resources** > **SSL Certificates**

    ![stack-ssl-certificate](/img/waf/v7/kb/resources-ssl-cert.png)

2.  ### Create request to generate SSL certificate for FQDN
    * Go to **Stack** > **Resources** > **SSL Certificate** 

    * Click on **Add Certificate** 

     * Enter certificate information as follows
        1. **Certificate Name**: User friendly name of the SSL scertificate
        2. **Certificate Domain**: Enter (single or wildcard) FQDN of the SSL certificate.

            * Example **haltdos.com**, ***.haltdos.com**
        3. **Scope**: Select visibility of the SSL certificate to target resource such as FQDN or ALL.

    * Click on **Let's Encrypt to generate certificate**

    * Click on **Order Certificate**

    ![order-certificate](/img/waf/v7/kb/order-cert.png)

    > #### *Note: Keep login session and SSL certificate tab to verify challenge.*

&nbsp;

3. ### Choose Let'ts Encrypt challenge
    * For DNS challenge, login to DNS console and issue provided DNS record.
        * Login to DNS console

        * Create TXT record with mentioned name and value.

        :::note
            TXT record should be create while exclusion root domain name.

            For example,\
            TXT Record Name: ***_acme-challenge.example-xyz.haltdos.com***\
            TXT Record Value: ***P9-HvCoUm2058***

            For this, we have to create DNS record as follows
                | Record Type | Record Name         | Record Value    |
                | :---------: | :-----------------: | :-------------: |
                | TXT         | _acme-challenge     | P9-HvCoUm2058   |

        :::
        DNS verification can be performed using command prompt or online DNS checker [here](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/).

        * For windows, use **nslookup** command
            ```
            nslookup -type=TXT _acme-challenge.example-xyz.haltdos.com
            ```

        * For Linux, use **dig** command
            ```
            dig TXT _acme-challenge.example-xyz.haltdos.com
            ```
        Once metioned record value is visible in the public DNS reponse, click on issue certificate. Go to Step 5

    For this demonstration, we will proceed with HTTP challenge. For this, we have to perform WAF policy changes to issue SSL certificate.

    :::note
    For wildcard domain, only DNS based verification supported

4. ### Changes for HTTP challenge verification

    For HTTP challenge verification, we have to create below changes
    1. Create Web Page with challenge response. To create web page, enter below information
        * **WebPage Name** - User friendly name
        * **Scope** - Choose scope of the content to listener

        Paste HTTP challenge content value in the web page and click on **Save Changes**.\
        \
        ![page-content](/img/waf/v7/kb/content-part.png)

    2. Create custom security profile in the MITIGATION mode
        > Go to **Apps** > **WAF** > *[Select Listener/FQDN]* > **Security Profiles**
        
    3. Create custom security profile with below filter
        | Property Name    | Property Value         |
        | :-----------:    | :-----------------:    |
        | Profile Name     | SSL Challenge          |
        | Profile Priority | 0                      |
        | URI              | *^\\/\\.well-known\\/* |
        | Application Type | WEBSERVICE             |

    4. Click on **Save Changes**

        ![profile-change](/img/waf/v7/kb/profile-change.png)

    5. Click on Gear icon on the security profile named as **SSL Challenge**. 
        * Disable Signature Validations

        * Change Operation Mode to **MITIGATION**
        * Click on **Save Changes**
        * Go to **Rules** > **Firewall Rules**
        * Create firewall policy as follows
            | Property Name    | Property Value         |
            | :-----------:    | :-----------------:    |
            | Rule Name        | SSL Challenge          |
            | Rule Description | SSL Challenge          |
            | Rule Priority    | 0                      |
            | URI              | .*                     |
            | Method           | ALL                    |
            | Rule Action      | Send Custom Response   |
            | Match Condition  | Pattern Exists         |
            | Match Pattern    | .*                     |

        * Click on **Save Changes**.

        &nbsp;
        :::note
            If Redirection policy exists for HTTP to HTTPs or external URL on WAF, perform below change

                Change **Match URL** parameter: 
                ```
                ^http://example-xyz.hltdos.com/(.*)$
                ```
                to
                ```
                ^http://example-xyz.hltdos.com/(?!\.well-known\/)(.*)$
                ```
        :::

    6. Verify  challenge , copy the URL from the **Challenge page** and open it in the browser.

    ![page-content](/img/waf/v7/kb/web-content.png)

    7. Click on verify challenge and wait for challenge completion.

    &nbsp;
    **We have succesfully issued certificate from Let's Encrypt.**

5. ### Remove changes after challenge verification
    * Remove configuration change or DNS record.

&nbsp;

6. ### Attach issued SSL certificate
    > Go to **Apps** > **WAF** > *[Select Listener Name]* > **SSL Settings**.

    * Update **SSL certificate** under SSL Settings of the listener and click on **Save changes**.

    ![ssl-settings](/img/waf/v7/kb/adding-ssl.png)
