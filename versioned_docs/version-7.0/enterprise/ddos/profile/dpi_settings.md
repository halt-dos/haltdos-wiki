# DPI Settings

Deep packet inspection an advance method of examining and managing network traffic

---

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is one of the most effective methods of analyzing and controlling network connections. It is a form of packet filtering that cannot be detected by normal packet filters, inspects packet headers only, detects, identifies, distributes, and redirects or blocks packets containing special information or payload numbers.

#### How Haltdos DPI Works

Deep packet inspection examines the headers of packets passing through the DDoS device and makes real-time decisions depending on packet information. We check the incoming/outgoing packets follow the RFC standards. User can customize which standard should be check for in/out traffic.
