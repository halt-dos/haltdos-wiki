# SNMP

---

## Overview

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an application–layer protocol defined by the Internet Architecture Board (IAB) in RFC1157 for exchanging management information between network devices. It is a part of Transmission Control Protocol⁄Internet Protocol (TCP⁄IP) protocol suite.

#### How SNMP works

SNMP on haltdos devices communicate with a network management system to relay status information and configuration changes. The NMS provides a single interface from which administrators can issue batch commands and receive automatic alerts.

SNMP relies on the concept of an MIB to organize how information about device metrics gets exchanged. The MIB is a formal description of a network device's components and status information.

SNMP uses a blend of pull and push communications between network devices and the network management system. Haltdos devices that communicate through SNMP respond to it by delivering protocol data units, commonly known as SNMP GET requests. All of these communications are recorded, and network monitoring software uses them to obtain SNMP data. Network admins can track the data value they specify using these queries.
