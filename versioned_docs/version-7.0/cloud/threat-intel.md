# Threat Intelligence

Haltdos Threat Stream - comprehensive global threat intelligence from Haltdos

---

Haltdos security solutions - hardware, virtual or Haltdos Cloud are backed by our unified Threat Intelligence feed - Haltdos Threat Stream. This threat intelligence feed is compatible with all Haltdos products and ensure that the solution can leverage this feed to take necessary (and pre-emptive) actions. 

Haltdos uses multiple sources of threat intel computation - OSS, Paid, Research and Community.
- OSS Threat Intel: Open-source intelligence is derived from information accessible to the public and is gathered, processed, and delivered to the proper audience in a timely manner to address a particular intelligence demand.
- Paid Threat Intel: From subscription of other threat intel service providers
- Research Threat Intel: Threat intel computed from internal and collaborative research and discovery
- Community Threat Intel: Threat intel computed from existing deployment of Haltdos products and community sharing of IoCs within Haltdos customers

Haltdos Threat Stream is automatically pulled by any licensed Haltdos product. Based on the license, the frequency of pulling threat intel may vary - typically though, it is done on a daily basis.
