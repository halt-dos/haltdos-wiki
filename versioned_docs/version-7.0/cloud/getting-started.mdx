# Getting Started

Haltdos Cloud is a managed Security-as-a-Service where no infrastructure needs to be placed inside client network. Through DNS redirection, any application - no matter where it might be hosted can be easily protected.

## Onboarding Process

![deployment](/img/saas/deployment.png)

Consider an application www.example.com. Change you DNS record from current A record to a CNAME record generated in the previous step. 

1. Create a Listener with the same FQDN on Haltdos Cloud Portal

2. The portal will generate a unique FQDN (in this case www.example.hdsec.xyz) for the newly created listener

3. Go to your DNS provider and change your DNS record for the FQDN from A record to CNAME with value www.example.hdsec.xyz
