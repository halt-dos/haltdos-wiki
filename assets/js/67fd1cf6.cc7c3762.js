The active\u2011passive scheme removes the requirement to synchronize data across sites in real-time. Instead, a simpler batch method using less expensive out\u2011of\u2011band connections can be used to distribute active site changes to the passive sites. In the above scenario, the role of the global server load balancer would be to simply detect the failure at the active site and divert requests to the passive sites automatically. This could be seen as automation of a manual process of changing the IP address in the DNS configuration for an FQDN.
